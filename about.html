                    We believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the verbally inspired Word of God, 
                    the final authority for faith and life, inerrant to the original writings, infallible and God-breathed 
                    (2 Timothy 3:16,17; 2 Peter 1:20,21; Matthew 5:18; John 16:12,13).

                <p>
                    We believe in one Triune God, eternally existing in three persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—co-eternal in being, 
                    co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfections 
                    (Deuteronomy 6:4; 2 Corinthians 13:14).

                    <li>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men (John 1:1-2,14; Luke 1:35).</li>
                    <li>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross for all mankind as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice to accomplish the redemption and justification of all who trust in Him is assured by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead (Romans 3:24-25; 4:25; Ephesians 1:7; 1 Timothy 4:10; Hebrews 2:9; 1 Peter 1:3-5; 2:24; 2 Peter 2:1).</li>
                    <li>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to heaven, and is now exalted on the right hand of God, where, as our high priest, He fulfills the ministry of representative, intercessor, and advocate (Acts 1:9,10; Hebrews 9:24; 7:25; Romans 8:34; 1 John 2:1-2).</li>

                    <li>We believe that the Holy Spirit is a person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; and that he is the supernatural agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ, indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption (John 16:8-11; 2 Corinthians 3:6; 1 Corinthians 12:12-14; Romans 8:9; Ephesians 1:13-14).</li>
                    <li>We believe that He is the divine teacher who guides believers into all truth; and, that it is the privilege and duty of all the saved to be filled with the Spirit (John 16:13; 1 John 2:20,27; Ephesians 5:18).</li>

                    We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God, but that in Adam’s sin the race fell, inherited a sinful nature, and became alienated from God; and, that man is totally depraved, and of himself, utterly unable to remedy his lost condition (Genesis 1:26-27; Romans 3:22,23; Ephesians 2:1-3,12).

                    We believe that salvation is the gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of our sins (Ephesians 2:8-10; John 1:12; Ephesians 1:7; 1 Peter 1:18,19).

                    <li>We believe that it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s Word; which, however clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty 
                        as an occasion to the flesh (Romans 13:13,14; Galatians 5:13; 
                        Titus 2:11-15).

                    We believe that every saved person possesses two natures, with provisions made for victory of the new nature over the old nature through the power of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit; 
                    and, that all claims to the eradication of the old nature in this life are unscriptural (Romans 6:13; 8:12,13; Galatians 5:16-25; Ephesians 4:22-24; Colossians 3:10; 1 Peter 1:14-16; 1 John 3:5-9).

                    We believe that all the saved should live in such a manner
                    as not to bring reproach upon their Savior and Lord; and, that separation from all religious apostasy, all worldly and sinful pleasure, practices, and associations is commanded of God (2 Timothy 3:1-5; Romans 12:1-2; 14:13; 1 John 2:15-17; 
                    2 John vv.9-11; 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1).

                    <li>We believe that God is sovereign in the bestowment of his gifts; and, that the gifts of evangelists, pastors, and teachers are sufficient for the perfecting of saints today; and that speaking in tongues and the working of sign miracles gradually ceased as the New Testament Scriptures were completed and their authority became established (1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 2 Corinthians 12:12; Ephesians 4:7-12).</li>
                    <li>We believe that the biblical offices of pastor and elder in the church, or their equivalents, are restricted to biblically qualified men (1 Timothy 2:12; 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9).
                        </li>
                    <li>We believe that God does hear and answers the prayer of faith, in accord with his own will, for the sick and afflicted (John 15:7; 1 John 5:14,15).</li>

                        body and the espoused bride of Christ, is a spiritual organism made up of all born-again persons of this present age (Ephesians 1:22,23; 5:25-27; 1 Corinthians 12:12-14;
                         2 Corinthians 11:2).
                        </li>
                    <li>We believe that the establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined to be in the New Testament Scriptures (Acts 14:27; 20:17, 28-32; 1 Timothy 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-11).
                        </li>
                    <li>We believe in the autonomy of the local church free of any external authority or control (Acts 13:1-4; 15:19-31; 20:28; Romans 16:1-4; 1 Corinthians 3:9,16; 5:4-7, 13; 1 Peter 5:1-4).</li>
                    <li>We believe in the ordinances of believer’s water baptism and the Lord’s supper as scriptural means of testimony for the church age (Matthew 28:19,20;
                        Acts 2:41,42; 18:8; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26).

                    We believe that the Scriptures interpreted in their natural, literal sense reveal divinely determined dispensations or rules of life which define man’s responsibilities in successive ages.  These dispensations are not ways of salvation, but rather divinely ordered stewardships by which God directs man according to his purpose.  Three of these –the age of law, the age of the Church, and the age of millennial kingdom—are the subjects of detailed revelation in Scripture (John 1:17; 1 Corinthians 9:17; 2 Corinthians 3:9-18; Galatians 3:13-25; Ephesians 1:10; 3:2-10; Colossians 1:24-25; Hebrews 7:19; Revelation 20:2-6).

                        We believe that the souls of the unbelievers remain, after death, in conscious misery until the second resurrection, when with soul and body reunited they shall appear at the Great White Throne of judgment and be cast into the Lake of Fire, not to be annihilated, but to suffer everlasting conscious punishment (Luke 16:19-26; Matthew 25:41-46; 
                        2 Thessalonians 1:7-9; Jude vv.6-7; Mark 9:43-48; Revelation 20:11-15).

                    We believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman.  We believe that union otherwise is out of harmony with the Word of God and inimical to the work of God (Genesis 1:27; 2:24; Matthew 19:4-6; 1 Corinthians 7:1-3).

                    <li><b>Ecumenism:</b> 
                        Ecumenism is that movement which seeks the organizational unity of all Christianity and ultimately all religions.  Its principal advocates are World Council of Churches and the Churches of Christ in the United States of America.

                        <b>Neo-Orthodoxy:</b>
                        Neo-Orthodoxy is that theological movement which affirms the transcendence of God, the finiteness and sinfulness of man, and the necessity of supernatural divine revelation of truth; but, while using evangelical terminology, seriously departs from orthodoxy.  In accepting the views of destructive higher criticism, in denying the inerrancy of the Bible as historic revelation, in accepting religious experience 
                as the criterion of truth, and in abandoning important fundamentals of the Christian faith.

                    <b>New Evangelicalism:</b>
                    Neo-Evangelicalism, New Conservationism
                  These terms refer to that movement within evangelicalism characterized by a toleration of and a dialogue with theological liberalism.  Its essence is seen in an emphasis upon the social application of the gospel and weak or unclear doctrines of the inspiration of Scripture, biblical creationism, eschatology, dispensationalism, and separation.  It is further characterized by an attempt to accommodate biblical Christianity and make it acceptable to the modern mind.
              We believe these movements are out of harmony with
           the Word of God and the official doctrine and position of the <a href="https://www.ifca.org/" style="color:blue">IFCA</a> and are inimical to the work of God.

                    In subscribing to these articles of faith, we by no means set aside, or undervalue, any of the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments; but we deem the knowledge, belief and acceptance of the truth as set forth in our doctrinal statement, to be essential to sound faith and fruitful practice, and therefore requisite for our Christian fellowship in the <a href="https://www.ifca.org/" style="color:blue">IFCA</a>.
